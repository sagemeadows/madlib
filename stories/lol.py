How to Respond to "{Lol=phrase}"

If someone sends you a(n) {text=noun} that simply says "{lol=phrase}," how should you respond? Whether you got the {text=noun} from a(n) {friend=person} or {crush=noun}, we’re here to help you figure out what their {text=noun} meant and how to use the context of the interaction to figure out the perfect response for every situation.

What does "{lol=phrase}" mean?
1. They think your last {text=noun} was {funny=adj}.
"{Lol=phrase}" literally means "{laughing={laugh=verb_i}+ing} out {loud=adj}." If you shared a(n) {story=noun}, {meme=noun}, {joke=noun}, or {photo=noun} and you get "{lol=phrase}" as a response, the person you {texted={text=verb_t}+past} is telling you that they think you’re {funny=adj}. Now, the person might not actually be {laughing={laugh=verb_i}+ing} {out loud=adv}, but "{lol=phrase}" generally indicates {amusement=abstract_noun}. "{Lol=phrase}" can also be used just to {acknowledge=verb_t} someone or something they said or to indicate a(n) {laid-back=adj} or {chill=adj} vibe.

2. They’re {acknowledging={acknowledge=verb_t}+ing} a(n) {awkward=adj} moment.
Sometimes, "{lol=phrase}" is used to convey a(n) {mood=abstract_noun} rather than a specific {phrase=noun}. If you just told someone about a(n) {embarrassing=adj} moment or {mistake=noun} you made, they might use "{lol=phrase}" to show they empathize with what you’re going through.

3. They don’t have anything else to {say=verb_t}.
"{Lol=phrase}" is a {common=adj} response when you’re not sure what else to {say=verb_t}. If the person doesn’t know how to respond to your last {message=noun}, they might just {say=verb_t} this {phrase=noun}.

4. They don’t want to {continue=verb_t} the interaction.
Sometimes, "{lol=phrase}" signals a lack of {interest=abstract_noun}. If the person you’re {texting={text=verb_t}+ing} uses {one=number}-word responses and doesn’t ask questions or put a lot of {effort=abstract_noun} into chatting with you, they might use "{lol=phrase}" as a way to signal that they’re done {talking={talk=verb_i}+ing}... at least for now.

How to Reply to "{lol=phrase}"
1. Reply with {lol=phrase}.
If you’re not sure what to do, just send "{lol=phrase}" back! Then, it’s up to them to figure out if and how to {continue=verb_t} the interaction. You could also send "{hehehe=phrase}" or "{hahaha=phrase}."

2. {Continue=verb_t} the interaction.
Refer back to the {message=noun} you sent before they replied with "{lol=phrase}" to keep interacting. Ask what they thought of your {joke=noun} or {story=noun} or see if they have any {advice=abstract_noun} or {input=abstract_noun} for you.

3. Respond with a(n) {gif=noun} or {meme=noun}.
Choose one that's related to the conversation, or just pick one you think is {funny=adj}. {Gifs={gif=noun}+pl} and {memes={meme=noun}+pl} are easy ways to bring a(n) {smile=noun} to your {friend=person} or {crush=noun}'s face and are great to use when you don't quite know what to {say=verb_t}.

4. {Change=verb_t} the {subject=noun}.
If you want to keep chatting with your {crush=noun} or {friend=person} but aren’t sure how to reply, just {change=verb_t} a(n) {new=adj} {subject=noun}. Asking a question is a great way to keep the interaction {going={go=verb_i}+ing}.

5. Let the interaction {end=verb_i}.
You don’t have to {reply to=verb_t} their {message=noun}, especially if the person isn’t putting much {effort=abstract_noun} into chatting. Just go about your {day=noun} and {text=verb_t} them again later if you have something to share or want to strike up a new conversation.

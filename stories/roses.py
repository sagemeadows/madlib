How to Keep {Roses={rose=noun}+pl} {Fresh=adj}

{Roses={rose=noun}+pl} are {beautiful=adj}, {fragrant=adj} {flowers={flower=noun}+pl} that come in a variety of colors and sizes. Given the right care, {roses={rose=noun}+pl} can stay {fresh=adj} for {a week and a half=duration} or more after being {cut=verb_t}. To keep your {roses={rose=noun}+pl} from {wilting={wilt=verb_i}+ing}, be sure to change their {water=liquid} {every few days=duration} and keep them in a(n) {cool=adj} spot.

Step 1: Selecting the {Freshest={fresh=adj}+est} {Roses={rose=noun}+pl}
1. {Cut=verb_t} your own {roses={rose=noun}+pl} early in the morning. If you're {cutting={cut=verb_t}+ing} {roses={rose=noun}+pl} from your own {rose=noun}bush to display indoors, {cut=verb_t} them as early as possible in the morning, before it gets {hot=adj} outside. {Cutting={cut=verb_t}+ing} them while it's still {cool=adj} will keep them from {wilting={wild=verb_i}+ing} just after {cutting={cut=verb_t}+ing}. Immediately after {cutting={cut=verb_t}+ing} the {roses={rose=noun}+pl}, put their {stems={stem=noun}+pl} in a clean bucket of fresh {water=liquid}.

2. Buy {cut={cut=verb_t}+part} {roses={rose=noun}+pl} from a(n) {florist=person} you trust. If you're not {cutting={cut=verb_t}+ing} your own {roses={rose=noun}+pl}, try to buy them from a well-{reputed={repute=verb_t}+part} {florist=person}, preferably one with whom you have a(n) {relationship=abstract_noun}. That way you'll be able to get your hands on {roses={rose=noun}+pl} that were very recently {cut={cut=verb_t}+part}, rather than {roses={rose=noun}+pl} that may have been sitting there for {a week=duration}.

3. Squeeze the {roses={rose=noun}+pl} where the {petals=pl_noun} meet the {stem=noun}. This is a sure way to tell whether {roses={rose=noun}+pl} are still fresh. When you're examining {roses={rose=noun}+pl} before making your purchase, gently squeeze them at their base, where the {petals=pl_noun} come together at the {stem=noun}. If it feels {loose=adj} and squishy, the {roses={rose=noun}+pl} are {old=adj}, and you should avoid them. If it feels {firm=adj} and {taut=adj}, the {roses={rose=noun}+pl} are {fresh=adj}.

4. Keep them in {water=liquid} on the way home. If the {roses={rose=noun}+pl} are out of {water=liquid} even for {a few minutes=duration}, they'll suffer for it, and they won't stay {fresh=adj} as long. When you go to the {flower=noun} shop, you might want to bring along a bucket filled with a few inches of {water=liquid} so you'll have a place to keep the {roses={rose=noun}+pl} {watered={water=liquid}+part} when you take them home. If you don't have a bucket, ask the {florist=person} to package them with {water=liquid}.

Step 2: Displaying the {Roses={rose=noun}+pl}
1.  Fill a(n) {vase=noun} with fresh {water=liquid}. {Roses={rose=noun}+pl} take in a lot of {water=liquid} after they're {cut={cut=verb_t}+part}. Fill the {vase=noun} 3/4 full with fresh, {cool=adj} {water=liquid} from the tap, then arrange the {flowers={flower=noun}+pl} in the vase so that the {stems={stem=noun}+pl} are within an inch of the bottom of the {vase=noun}. This way they'll be able the reach the {water=liquid} they need to stay {fresh=adj}. Consider adding some {flower=noun} food to the water.

2. Change the {water=liquid} every {day=duration}.
Every {day=duration}, change the {water=liquid} to ensure that {bacterial=noun} growth doesn't damage your {flowers={flower=noun}+pl}. Fill the {vase=noun} with fresh {water=liquid}, more {flower=noun} food and the right amount of bleach. Trim the {stems={stem=noun}+pl} of your {roses={rose=noun}+pl} and arrange them in the {vase=noun} once more.

3. Keep the {roses={rose=noun}+pl} {cool=adj}. {Roses={rose=noun}+pl} will stay {fresh=adj} for many days if you keep them in a(n) {cool=adj} spot in the house. Avoid placing them near {sunny=adj} {windows=pl_noun} or in rooms that tend to be on the {warmer={warm=adj}+compar} side. You can even store your {roses={rose=noun}+pl} in the refrigerator overnight to keep them {cool=adj} while you sleep, then set them back out on the table during the day.
